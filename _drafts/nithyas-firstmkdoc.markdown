# The man whom I admire
  I can't say a single name, but there are many! You might be confused, I shall explain!


## Tagore
  Let's start with my favorite quote
  **Faith is the bird that feels the light when dawn is still dark**

  Another one comes there
  ** Everything that comes to us belongs to us only *if we create the capacity* to receive them **

  Lovely quotes! Ain't them?
